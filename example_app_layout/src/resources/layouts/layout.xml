<!--
The layout system works by taking each of the items listed in it
and creating an object which extends Ui.Drawable and placing them
in a list. Then inside a Ui.View object you can set a layout which
tells the system each time onUpdate() is called, go through and
draw each item in the list of drawables that make up the layout.

What we'll want to do is create Ui.Drawable objects for each of
the UI elements. I would create one for each of these:
    - PhoneConnectionView
    - CalorieCounterView
    - LifeLineSignalView
    - PedometerView (this is the smaller display in the bottom right)
    - PedometerCircleView (this is the arc that draws around watch info)
    - SecondsArcView
    - WatchHandsView (you could probably combine these last two)
    
Right now there's not a way to include custom Ui.Drawable items in 
a layout file. The work around is to add an item to the layout (a label
for instance) and replace it in the list before calling setLayout();
